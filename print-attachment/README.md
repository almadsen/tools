Based on the great work of the awesome Dave Caolo of 52tiger.net
Original can be found here: http://52tiger.net/print-from-ios-dropbox-ifttt-automator

Differences between our workflows:

* Mine assumes you don't want to use ifttt, and have a Mac that's always run
* My automator file automatically deletes the file after it's printed
