I will track all of my various tidbits in this repoâ€¦ Mostly AppleScripts and
Keyboard Maestro Macros.

But also some Ruby, Python and PHP scripts. Whatever I think might be
interesting for fellow Mac users.

So far:

## Marked preview

A very simple AppleScript to open the current document in Marked for quick
preview

## Print attachment

An AppleScript and an Automator workflow to automatically print attachments
that come in at a certain email address
