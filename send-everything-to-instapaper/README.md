A faily simple script:

1. It asks you for your Instapaper credentials; don't worry I don't send them
	 to some server of mine. Check the source if you like. (You can even hardcode
			 your credentials if you like that).
2. It takes a look at your front window in Safari
3. It loops through all your tabs and sends them to Instapaper
4. After sending a tab to Instapaper it's automatically closed
5. At the end of it all the window is closed and your Instapaper is full :)
